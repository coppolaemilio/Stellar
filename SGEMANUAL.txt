I. Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stellar Game Engine (or "SGE") is a game engine designed for use by
Stellar.  Its design is loosely based on the proprietary program, Game
Maker.  The purpose of SGE is to make game development easier, which
allows more rapid development by experienced game developers and also
helps less experienced game developers learn how to develop games.

Unlike Game Maker, you have freedom with SGE.  SGE is free software
(where "free" refers to freedom, not price; see
<http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html> for more information).  It is
released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which means you
can modify and redistribute it without restriction, and you can use it
however you wish.

Although the GNU Lesser General Public license does not require it, we
encourage you to release your games' code under a free software license,
such as the GNU General Public License, the Expat License (often called
the "MIT License"), or the Apache 2.0 License.  Doing so is easy, does
not negatively affect you, and is highly appreciated as a contribution
to free software.


II. SGE Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  II.A. Events
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Much like Game Maker, SGE uses an event-based system, with events
  defined by special class methods with names that start with "event_".

  Except in certain special cases, events are handled in an arbitrary
  order; if Event A and Event B happen at the same time, one
  implementation might handle Event A first, while another
  implementation might handle Event B first.  Still another
  implementation might in theory even handle Event A first one frame,
  then handle Event B in another.


  II.B. The Mouse
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The mouse is handled somewhat unusually in SGE.  Rather than having
  functions or variables report the mouse position relative to the
  screen, the mouse position within the room, calculated based on its
  position on the screen by SGE, is recorded in a special
  sge.StellarClass object which represents the mouse.  This mouse object
  can be found as sge.game.mouse, and it has the special object ID,
  "mouse".

  The mouse object differs from most sge.StellarClass objects in a few
  ways.  Its speed variables cannot be manually set, and they always
  report numbers which correspond to the average motion of the mouse
  during the last quarter of a second.  Setting sge.game.mouse.visible
  toggles whether or not the mouse cursor itself is visible, and setting
  sge.game.mouse.sprite sets the mouse cursor to the sprite assigned.

  In all other ways, the mouse object is exactly the same as all other
  sge.StellarClass objects.


  II.C. Colors
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Colors can be defined in SGE in a few ways.

    II.C.1. HTML Color Names
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The sixteen basic HTML colors, written as strings, are accepted by
    SGE.  These are case-insensitive, so "red" is the same as "Red" or
    "rEd".  The colors are:

    * "white"
    * "silver"
    * "gray"
    * "black"
    * "red"
    * "maroon"
    * "yellow"
    * "olive"
    * "lime"
    * "green"
    * "aqua"
    * "teal"
    * "blue"
    * "navy"
    * "fuchsia"
    * "purple"


    II.C.2. RGB(A) Tuples
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    A tuple containing three or four values is accepted as a color by
    SGE.  Each index represents a component of a color: first red, then
    green, then blue, with the values being integers from 0 to 255.  For
    example, (255, 128, 0) indicates a color with full red intensity,
    50% green intensity, and no blue intensity, which is a shade of
    orange.  Note that the colors combine as colors of light, not colors
    of pigment.

    The fourth value of the tuple, if specified, indicates the alpha
    transparency of the color, with the values again being integers from
    0 to 255.  255 is fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and any
    value in between indicates the amount of transparency; for example,
    128 is 50% transparent.  If the fourth value is unspecified, it is
    assumed that the color is fully opaque.

    RGBA tuples are the only way to specify alpha transparency of colors
    in SGE.  All other methods for indicating color assume full opacity.


    II.C.3. HTML Hex Strings
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    An HTML hex string is accepted as a color by SGE.  HTML hex strings
    are in the format "#RRGGBB", where "RR", "GG", and "BB" are replaced
    with the red, green, and blue components of the color, respectively,
    in hexadecimal form.  FF (equivalent to 255 in decimal form) is full
    intensity of the respective color, and 00 (equivalent to 0 in
    decimal form) is no intensity of the respective color.  For example,
    "#FF8000" is the same as (255, 128, 0), or orange.


    II.C.4. Hexadecimal Integers
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    A hexadecimal integer is accepted as a color by SGE.  This should be
    in the same form as HTML hex strings, but integral.  For example,
    0xFF8000 is the same as (255, 128, 0), or orange.


  II.D. Z-Axis
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  SGE uses a Z-axis attribute to determine where objects are placed in
  the third dimension.  Objects with a higher Z value are considered to
  be closer to the viewer.  For example, an object with a Z value of 5
  is in front of an object with a Z value of 2.

  The Z-axis is only used to determine how to project images when they
  overlap. In this case, the object which is in front will partially
  (or, in some cases, fully) cover the other object.

  If two objects with the same Z-axis value overlap, SGE arbitrarily
  chooses which one to project in front.


III. Global Variables and Constants
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constants:
* IMPLEMENTATION: A string identifying the how the engine is implemented
    (e.g. the name of the graphics library used).
* ALIGN_LEFT: Flag indicating alignment to the left.
* ALIGN_CENTER: Flag indicating alignment to the horizontal center.
* ALIGN_RIGHT: Flag indicating alignment to the right.
* ALIGN_TOP: Flag indicating alignment to the top.
* ALIGN_MIDDLE: Flag indicating alignment to the vertical middle.
* ALIGN_BOTTOM: Flag indicating alignment to the bottom.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds with the
    left mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds with the
    right mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE: The mouse button number which corresponds with
    the middle mouse button.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP: The mouse button number which corresponds with
    rolling the mouse wheel up.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with rolling the mouse wheel down.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with tilting the mouse wheel to the left.
* MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT: The mouse button number which corresponds
    with tilting the mouse wheel to the right.

Global variables:
* game: Stores the current game.  If there is no game currently, this
    variable is set to None.
* image_directories: A list of directories where images can be found.
    Default is ./data/images, ./data/sprites, or ./data/backgrounds.
* font_directories: A list of directories where font files can be found.
    Default is ./data/fonts.
* sound_directories: A list of directories where sounds can be found.
    Default is ./data/sounds.
* music_directories: A list of directories where music files can be
    found.  Default is ./data/music.


IV. Classes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes are the heart of SGE's operation.  Most functionality in games
is best implemented via subclassing SGE's classes.


  IV.A. sge.Game
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class handles most parts of the game which operate on a global
  scale, such as global game events.  Before anything else is done with
  SGE, an object either of this class or of a class derived from this
  class must be created.

  When an object of this class is created, it is automatically assigned
  to sge.game.

  Note: Do not create multiple sge.Game objects.  Doing so may cause
  errors.

  Attributes:
  * width: The width of the game's display in pixels.
  * height: The height of the game's display in pixels.
  * fullscreen: True if the game should be in fullscreen, False
      otherwise.
  * scale: A number indicating a fixed scale factor (e.g. 1 for no
      scaling, 2 for doubled size).  If set to 0, scaling is automatic
      (causes the game to fit the window or screen).
  * scale_proportional: If set to True, scaling is always
      proportional.  If set to False, the image may be stretched to
      completely fill the game window or screen.  This has no effect
      unless ``scale`` is 0.
  * scale_smooth: If set to True, a smooth scaling algorithm will be
      used, if available.  Otherwise, simple scaling (e.g. pixel
      doubling) will always be used.  Support for smooth scaling in
      Stellar Game Engine implementations is optional.  If the
      implementation used does not support smooth scaling, this option
      will always be treated as False.
  * fps: The rate the game should run in frames per second.  Note that
      this is only the maximum; if the computer is not fast enough, the
      game may run more slowly.
  * delta: If set to True, delta timing will be enabled, which adjusts
      speeds and animation rates if the game cannot run at the specified
      frame rate.
  * delta_min: Delta timing can cause the game to be choppy.  This
      setting limits this by pretending that the frame rate is never
      lower than this amount, resulting in the game slowing down like
      normal if it is.
  * grab_input: If set to True, all input will be locked into the game.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * sprites: A dictionary containing all loaded sprites, using their
      names as the keys.
  * background_layers: A dictionary containing all loaded background
      layers, using their sprites' names as the keys.
  * backgrounds: A dictionary containing all loaded backgrounds, using
      their unique identifiers as the keys.
  * fonts: A dictionary containing all loaded fonts, using their names
      as the keys.
  * sounds: A dictionary containing all loaded sounds, using their file
      names as the keys.
  * music: A dictionary containing all loaded music, using their file
      names as the keys.
  * objects: A dictionary containing all sge.StellarClass objects in the
      game, using their unique identifiers as the keys.
  * rooms: A list containing all rooms in order of their creation.
  * current_room: The Room object which is currently active.
  * mouse: An sge.StellarClass object which represents the mouse cursor.
      Its ID is "mouse" and its bounding box is one pixel.  Speed
      variables are determined by averaging all mouse movement during
      the last quarter of a second.  Assigning to its ``visible``
      attribute controls whether or not the mouse cursor is shown.
      Setting its sprite sets the mouse cursor.


    IV.A.1. Constructor Method (sge.Game.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.__init__(self, width=640, height=480, fullscreen=False,
        scale=0, scale_proportional=True, scale_smooth=False, fps=60,
        delta=False, delta_min=15)

    All arguments are used to set the respective initial attributes of
    the object.


    IV.A.2. sge.Game.start
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.start(self)

    Starts the game in the first room.  This method can also be called
    at any time during the game to restart the game, resetting
    everything to its original state.


    IV.A.3. sge.Game.end
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.end(self)

    Ends the game.  Please use this rather than sys.exit, as some
    implementations might do some clean-up here.


    IV.A.4. sge.Game.pause
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.pause(self, sprite=None)

    Pauses the game, showing ``sprite`` (an sge.Sprite object) in the
    center of the screen.  If ``sprite`` is None, a default image is
    used instead; the exact image used is implementation-dependent.

    Normal events are not executed while the game is paused.  Instead,
    events with the same name, but prefixed with "event_paused_" instead
    of "event_", are executed.  Note that not all events have these
    alternative "paused" events associated with them.


    IV.A.5. sge.Game.unpause
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.unpause(self)

    Unpauses the game.


    IV.A.6. sge.Game.event_game_start
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_game_start(self)

    Game Start event.  This event is executed when the game starts.  It
    is only executed once (it is not executed again when the game
    restarts) and it is always the very first event executed.


    IV.A.7. sge.Game.event_game_end
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_game_end(self)

    Game End event.  This event is executed when the game ends.  It is
    only executed once and it is always the very last event executed.


    IV.A.8. sge.Game.event_step
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_step(self, time_passed)

    Step event.  This event is always executed once each frame.
    ``time_passed`` indicates the number of milliseconds that have
    passed during the last frame.


    IV.A.9. sge.Game.event_key_press
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_key_press(self, key)

    Key Press event.  This event is executed when a key on the keyboard
    is pressed.  ``key`` indicates the identifier string of the key that
    was pressed (see KEYS.txt for a list of all key identifier strings).


    IV.A.10. sge.Game.event_key_release
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_key_release(self, key)

    Key Release event.  This event is executed when a key on the
    keyboard is released.  ``key`` indicates the identifier string of
    the key that was released (see KEYS.txt for a list of all key
    identifier strings).


    IV.A.11. sge.Game.event_mouse_move
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_mouse_move(self, x, y)

    Mouse Move event.  This event is executed when the mouse moves.
    ``x`` indicates the horizontal relative movement of the mouse, and
    ``y`` indicates the vertical relative movement of the mouse.


    IV.A.12. sge.Game.event_mouse_button_press
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event_mouse_button_press(self, button)

    Mouse Button Press event.  This event is executed when a mouse
    button is pressed.  ``button`` indicates the number of the button
    that was pressed.  What button numbers correspond to what buttons
    can vary among implementations, so ``button`` should be checked
    against the following constants:

    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT


    IV.A.13. sge.Game.event_mouse_button_release
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Game.event.mouse_button_release(self, button)

    Mouse Button Release event.  This event is executed when a mouse
    button is released.  ``button`` indicates the number of the button
    that was released.  What button numbers correspond to what buttons
    can vary among implementations, so ``button`` should be checked
    against the following constants:

    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP

    Joystick Axis Move event.  This event is executed when an axis on a
    joystick changes position.  ``joystick`` indicates the number of the
    joystick, where 0 is the first joystick.  ``axis`` indicates the
    number of the axis, where 0 is the first axis.  ``value`` indicates
    the tilt of the axis, where 0 is in the center, -1 is tilted all the
    way to the left or up, and 1 is tilted all the way to the right or
    down.  Note that ``value`` can be any floating-point number between
    -1 and 1; it is not limited to integral values.

    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.

    (also called the POV hat, POV switch, or d-pad) changes position.
    ``joystick`` indicates the number of the joystick, where 0 is the
    first joystick.  ``hat`` indicates the number of the HAT, where 0 is
    the first HAT.  ``x`` indicates the horizontal position of the HAT,
    where 0 is in the center, -1 is left, and 1 is right.  ``y``
    indicates the vertical position of the HAT, where 0 is in the
    center, -1 is up, and 1 is down.

    Support for joysticks in SGE implementations is optional.

    Default Mouse Collision event.  This event is executed when another
    object collides with sge.game.mouse and none of the directional
    collision events are appropriate.  In particular, this event is
    executed if the collision was already happening in the previous
    frame, meaning that the object is colliding with the inside of the
    mouse. In addition, directional mouse collision events cause this
    event to execute by default if they are not overridden.  ``other``
    indicates the other object which was collided with.

  IV.B. sge.Sprite
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores images and information about how SGE is to use those
  images.

  What image formats are supported depends on the implementation of SGE,
  but image formats that are generally a good choice are PNG, JPEG, and
  uncompressed BMP.  See the implementation's readme for a full list of
  supported formats.

  Attributes:
  * width: The width of the sprite in pixels.
  * height: The height of the sprite in pixels.
  * origin_x: The horizontal location of the origin (the pixel position
      in relation to the images to base rendering on), where the left
      edge of the image is 0 and origin_x increases toward the right.
  * origin_y: The vertical location of the origin (the pixel position in
      relation to the images to base rendering on), where the top edge
      of the image is 0 and origin_y increases toward the bottom.
  * transparent: True if the image should support transparency, False
      otherwise.  If the image does not have an alpha channel or if the
      implementation used does not support alpha transparency, a
      colorkey will be used, with the transparent color being the color
      of the top-rightmost pixel.
  * fps: The suggested rate in frames per second to animate the image
      at.
  * bbox_x: The horizontal location of the top-left corner of the
      suggested bounding box to use with this sprite, where origin_x is
      0 and bbox_x increases toward the right.
  * bbox_y: The vertical location of the top-left corner of the
      suggested bounding box to use with this sprite, where origin_y is
      0 and bbox_y increases toward the bottom.
  * bbox_width: The width of the suggested bounding box in pixels.
  * bbox_height: The height of the suggested bounding box in pixels.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * name: The name of the sprite given when it was created.


    IV.B.1. Cunstructor Method (sge.Sprite.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.__init__(self, name=None, width=None, height=None,
        origin_x=0, origin_y=0, transparent=True, fps=60, bbox_x=0,
        bbox_y=0, bbox_width=None, bbox_height=None)

    ``name`` indicates the base name of the image files.  All remaining
    arguments are used to set the respective initial attributes of the
    object.

    The base name is used to find all individual image files which make
    up this sprite's animation.  First, a file who's name consists only
    of the base name plus a valid image extension is searched for.  If
    no such image is available, files with names consisting of the base
    name followed by either an underscore ("_") or a hyphen ("-") and
    then a positive integer are searched for, to be used as a single
    animation with the frames ordered by number (the lowest number is
    the first frame).  If neither of these methods return any results, a
    file with names consisting of the base name followed by either
    "_strip" or "-strip" and then an integer is searched for to be used
    as an animation; the image is split into a number of sections
    indicated by the number horizontally, like a horizontal reel.

    The following are all examples of images that will be loaded for a
    sprite given the base name "foo":
    * foo.png (single-frame, no animation)
    * foo-0.png (frame 0; the next frame would be foo-1.png)
    * foo-strip4.png (split horizontally into four sections)

    The base name can also be None, in which case the sprite will be a
    fully transparent rectangle at the specified size (with both
    ``width`` and ``height`` defaulting to 32 if they are set to None).
    The implementation decides what to assign to the sprite's ``name``
    attribute in this case, but it will always be a string.

    If no image is found based on any of the above methods and the base
    name is not None, IOError will be raised.

    If ``width`` or ``height`` is set to None, the respective size will
    be taken from the largest animation frame.  If ``bbox_width`` or
    ``bbox_height`` is set to None, it will be taken from ``width`` or
    ``height``, respectively.


    IV.B.2. sge.Sprite.draw_dot
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_dot(self, x, y, color, frame=None)

    Draws a single-pixel dot on this sprite.  ``x`` and ``y`` indicate
    the location in the sprite to draw the dot, where (0,0) is the
    origin of the sprite and x and y increase toward the right and
    bottom, respectively.  ``color`` indicates the color of the dot.
    ``frame`` indicates the frame of the sprite to draw on, where 0 is
    the first frame; set to None to draw on all frames.


    IV.B.3. sge.Sprite.draw_line
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_line(self, x1, y1, x2, y2, color, thickness=1,
        ant_alias=False, frame=None)

    Draws a line segment on this sprite.  ``x1``, ``y1``, ``x2``, and
    ``y2`` indicate the locations in the sprite of the two points
    between which to draw the line segment, where (0,0) is the origin of
    the sprite and x and y increase toward the right and bottom,
    respectively.  ``color`` indicates the color of the line segment.
    ``thickness`` indicates the thickness of the line segment in pixels.
    ``anti_alias`` indicates whether or not anti-aliasing should be
    used, which uses different color shades to make the line appear
    straighter.  ``frame`` indicates the frame of the sprite to draw on,
    where 0 is the first frame; set to None to draw on all frames.

    Support for anti-aliasing is optional in Stellar Game Engine
    implementations.  See the implementation's readme to see if it
    supports anti-aliasing.  If anti-aliasing is unsupported,
    ``anti_alias`` will be ignored.


    IV.B.4. sge.Sprite.draw_rectangle
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_rectangle(self, x, y, width, height, fill=None,
        outline=None, outline_thickness=1, frame=None)

    Draws a rectangle on this sprite.  ``x`` and ``y`` indicate the
    location in the sprite to position the top-left corner of the
    rectangle, where (0,0) is the origin of the sprite and x and y
    increase toward the right and bottom, respectively.  ``width`` and
    ``height`` indicate the size of the rectangle.  ``fill`` indicates
    the  color of the fill of the rectangle; set to None for no fill.
    ``outline`` indicates the color of the outline of the rectangle; set
    to None for no outline.  ``outline_thickness`` indicates the
    thickness of the outline in pixels (ignored if there is no outline).
    ``frame`` indicates the frame of the sprite to draw on, where 0 is
    the first frame; set to None to draw on all frames.


    IV.B.5. sge.Sprite.draw_ellipse
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_ellipse(self, x, y, width, height, fill=None,
        outline=None, outline_thickness=1, anti_alias=False, frame=None)

    Draws an ellipse on this sprite.  ``x`` and ``y`` indicate the
    location in the sprite to position the top-left corner of the
    imaginary rectangle containing the ellipse, where (0,0) is the
    origin of the sprite and x and y increase toward the right and
    bottom, respectively.  ``width`` and ``height`` indicate the size of
    the ellipse.  ``fill``indicates the color of the fill of the
    ellipse; set to None for no fill.  ``outline`` indicates the color
    of the outline of the ellipse; set to None for no outline.
    ``outline_thickness`` indicates the thickness of the outline in
    pixels (ignored if there is no outline).  ``anti_alias`` indicates
    whether or not anti-aliasing should be used, which uses different
    color shades to make the ellipse appear more rounded.  ``frame``
    indicates the frame of the sprite to draw on, where 0 is the first
    frame; set to None to draw on all frames.

    Support for anti-aliasing is optional in Stellar Game Engine
    implementations.  See the implementation's readme to see if it
    supports anti-aliasing.  If anti-aliasing is unsupported,
    ``anti_alias`` will be ignored.


    IV.B.6. sge.Sprite.draw_circle
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_circle(self, x, y, radius, fill=None, outline=None,
        outline_thickness=1, anti_alias=False, frame=None)

    Draws a circle on this sprite.  ``x`` and ``y`` indicate the
    location in the sprite to position the center of the circle, where
    (0,0) is the origin of the sprite and x and y increase toward the
    right and bottom, respectively.  ``radius`` indicates the radius of
    the circle in pixels.  ``fill`` indicates the color of the fill of
    the circle; set to None for no fill.  ``outline`` indicates the
    color of the outline of the circle; set to None for no outline.
    ``outline_thickness`` indicates the thickness of the outline in
    pixels (ignored if there is no outline).  ``anti_alias`` indicates
    whether or not anti-aliasing should be used, which uses different
    color shades to make the circle appear more rounded.  ``frame``
    indicates the frame of the sprite to draw on, where 0 is the first
    frame; set to None to draw on all frames.

    Support for anti-aliasing is optional in Stellar Game Engine
    implementations.  See the implementation's readme to see if it
    supports anti-aliasing.  If anti-aliasing is unsupported,
    ``anti_alias`` will be ignored.


    IV.B.7. sge.Sprite.draw_sprite
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_sprite(self, sprite, image, x, y, frame=None)

    Draws another sprite on this sprite.  ``sprite`` indicates the
    sprite to draw with.  ``image`` indicates the frame of ``sprite`` to
    draw ``self``, where 0 is the first frame. ``x`` and ``y`` indicate
    the location in ``self`` to position the origin of ``sprite``, where
    (0,0) is the origin of ``self`` and x and y increase toward the
    right and bottom, respectively.  ``frame`` indicates the frame of
    ``self`` to draw on, where 0 is the first frame; set to None to draw
    on all frames.


    IV.B.8. sge.Sprite.draw_text
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_text(self, font, text, x, y, width=None,
        height=None, color="black", halign=sge.ALIGN_LEFT,
        valign=sge.ALIGN_TOP, anti_alias=True, frame=None)

    Draws text on this sprite.  ``font`` indicates the font to use to
    draw the text.  ``text`` indicates the text to draw.  ``x`` and
    ``y`` indicate the location in the sprite to position the imaginary
    box containing the text, where (0,0) is the origin of the sprite and
    x and y increase toward the right and bottom, respectively.
    ``width`` and ``height`` indicate the size of the imaginary box the
    text is drawn in; set to None to assign the respective size to
    whatever is needed to contain the text.  ``color`` indicates the
    color of the text.  ``halign`` indicates the horizontal alignment of
    the imaginary box containing the text with respect to ``x`` as well
    as the horizontal alignment of the text itself and can be
    sge.ALIGN_LEFT, sge.ALIGN_CENTER, or sge.ALIGN_RIGHT.  ``valign``
    indicates the vertical alignment of the imaginary box containing the
    text with respect to ``y`` and can be sge.ALIGN_TOP,
    sge.ALIGN_MIDDLE, or sge.ALIGN_BOTTOM.  ``anti_alias`` indicates
    whether or not anti- aliasing should be used, which uses different
    color shades to to make round shapes appear more round and diagonal
    lines appear more straight.  ``frame`` indicates the frame of the
    sprite to draw on, where 0 is the first frame; set to None to draw
    on all frames.

    Text is fitted into the imaginary box much like a word processor; if
    the text is too long to fit in one line, the line will be
    automatically split into multiple lines.  After applying this rule,
    if the text does not fit vertically into the imaginary box, text
    that doesn't fit will be cut off; from the bottom if ``valign`` is
    sge.ALIGN_TOP, from the top if ``valign`` is sge.ALIGN_BOTTOM, or
    equally from the top and the bottom if ``valign`` is
    sge.ALIGN_MIDDLE.

    Support for anti-aliasing is optional in Stellar Game Engine
    implementations.  See the implementation's readme to see if it
    supports anti-aliasing.  If anti-aliasing is unsupported,
    ``anti_alias`` will be ignored.


    IV.B.9. sge.Sprite.draw_clear
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sprite.draw_clear(self, frame=None)

    Erases everything from frames on this sprite.  ``frame`` indicates
    the frame of the sprite to clear, where 0 is the first frame; set to
    None to clear all frames.  Once a frame is cleared, it will be a
    fully transparent (invisible) rectangle.

    Use this method to re-draw something. For example, you could have a
    sprite that shows the player's current score; when the score
    changes, clear the sprite with this method and then draw the new
    score.


  IV.C. sge.BackgroundLayer
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores a sprite and certain information for a layer of a
  background.  In particular, it stores the location of the layer,
  whether the layer tiles horizontally, vertically, or both, and the
  rate at which it scrolls.

  The attributes xscroll_rate and yscroll_rate indicate the rate that
  the layer scrolls (or moves) as a factor of the respective movement of
  the view.  For example, a value of 1 results in the layer scrolling at
  the same rate as the view, and a value of 2 results in the layer
  scrolling twice as fast as the view.  By setting different layers to
  scroll at different rates, you can easily enable a parallax scrolling
  effect.

  Attributes:
  * sprite: The sge.Sprite object used for this layer.  It will be
      animated if it contains multiple frames.
  * x: The horizontal position in a background to place the sprite's
      origin, where 0 is the left edge of the background and x increases
      toward the right.
  * y: The vertical position in a background to place the sprite's
      origin, where 0 is the top edge of the background and y increases
      toward the bottom.
  * z: The Z-axis position of the layer in the room, where higher
      values are closer to the viewer.
  * xscroll_rate: The horizontal speed the layer scrolls at as a factor
      of the view's movement.
  * yscroll_rate: The vertical speed the layer scrolls at as a factor of
      the view's movement.
  * xrepeat: Whether or not the layer should be repeated (or tiled)
      horizontally.
  * yrepeat: Whether or not the layer should be repeated (or tiled)
      vertically.


    IV.C.1. Constructor Method (sge.BackgroundLayer.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.BackgroundLayer.__init__(self, sprite, x, y, z, xscroll_rate=1,
        yscroll_rate=1, xrepeat=True, yrepeat=True)

    All arguments are used to set the respective initial attributes of
    the layer.


  IV.D. sge.Background
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores the layers that make up the background (which
  contain the information about what images to use and where) as well as
  the color to use where no image is shown.

  Attributes:
  * color: The color used in parts of the background where no layer is
      shown.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * id: The unique identifier for this background assigned to it when it
      was created.
  * layers: A tuple containing all sge.BackgroundLayer objects used in
      this background.


    IV.D.1. Constructor Method (sge.Background.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Background.__init__(self, layers, color, id=None)

    All arguments are used to set the respective initial attributes of
    the background.  If ``id`` is None, it will be set to an integer not
    currently used as an ID (the exact number chosen is determined by
    the implementation and may vary between runs).


  IV.E. sge.Font
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores a font for use by Sprite.draw_text.

  Note that bold and italic rendering could be ugly.  It is better to
  choose a bold or italic font rather than enabling bold or italic
  rendering, if possible.

  Attributes:
  * size: The height of the font in pixels.
  * underline: Whether or not underlined rendering is enabled.
  * bold: Whether or not bold rendering is enabled.
  * italic: Whether or not italic rendering is enabled.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * name: The name of the font, as specified when it was created.


    IV.E.1. Constructor Method (sge.Font.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Font.__init__(self, name=None, size=12, underline=False,
        bold=False, italic=False)

    ``name`` indicates the name of the font.  This can be either the
    name of a font file, to be located in one of the directories
    specified in sge.font_directories, or the name of a system font.  If
    the specified font does not exist in either form, a default font
    will be chosen by SGE (the default font can vary between
    implementations).   ``name`` can also be a list or tuple of fonts to
    choose from in order of preference.  All remaining arguments are
    used to set the respective initial attributes of the font.

    Note that it is generally not a good practice to rely on system
    fonts.  A font you have on your system might not be a font that
    everyone has on their system.  For example, one common font on
    Windows systems is Times New Roman, but GNU/Linux systems don't
    usually have this font, instead having fonts like Liberation Serif
    or DejaVu Serif.  SGE is supposed to make an attempt to match
    compatible fonts, but this is not required of SGE implementations,
    so it should not be relied upon.  Instead, choose a font with a
    free license (such as the SIL Open Font License or the GNU General
    Public License) and distribute it with your game.


    IV.E.2. sge.Font.get_size
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Font.get_size(self, text, width=None, height=None)

    Returns the size of a certain string of text when rendered.  All
    arguments correspond with the same arguments from sge.font.render,
    and the size returned reflects the rendering rules therein.  The
    value returned is a tuple in the form (width, height).


  IV.F. sge.Sound
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores and plays sound effects.  Note that this is
  inefficient for large music files; for those, use sge.Music instead.

  What sound formats are supported depends on the implementation of SGE,
  but sound formats that are generally a good choice are Ogg Vorbis and
  uncompressed WAV.  See the implementation's readme for a full list of
  supported formats.

  Attributes:
  * volume: The volume of the sound in percent (0 for no sound, 100 for
      max sound).
  * balance: The balance of the sound effect on stereo speakers.  A
      value of 0 means centered (an equal amount of play on both
      speakers), -1 means entirely in the left speaker, and 1 means

    ``fname`` indicates the name of the sound file (e.g. "mysound.wav")
    to be located in one of the directories specified in
    sge.sound_directories.  All remaining arguments set the respective
    initial attributes of the sound.


    IV.F.2. sge.Sound.play
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sound.play(self, loops=0, maxtime=None, fade_time=None)

    Plays the sound.  ``loops`` indicates the number of extra times to
    play the sound after it is played the first time; set to None to
    loop indefinitely.  ``maxtime`` indicates the maximum amount of time
    to play the sound in milliseconds; set to None for no limit.
    ``fade_time`` indicates the time in milliseconds over which to fade
    the sound in; set to 0 or None to immediately play the sound at full
    volume.


    IV.F.3. sge.Sound.stop
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.Sound.stop(self, fade_time=None)

    Stops the sound.  ``fade_time`` indicates the time in milliseconds

    This is a static method.


  IV.G. sge.Music
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class stores and plays music.  Music is very similar to sound
  effects, but only one music file can be played at a time, and it is
  more efficient for larger files than sge.Sound.

  What music formats are supported depends on the implementation of SGE,
  but Ogg Vorbis is generally a good choice.  See the implementation's
  readme for a full list of supported formats.  You should avoid the
  temptation to use MP3 files; MP3 is a patent-encumbered format, so
  many systems do not support it and royalties to the patent holder may
  be required for commercial use.  There are many programs which can
  convert your MP3 files to the free Ogg Vorbis format.

  Attributes:
  * volume: The volume of the music in percent (0 for n sound, 100 for
      max sound).
  * balance: The balance of the music on stereo speakers.  A value of 0
      means centered (an equal amount of play on both speakers), -1
      means entirely in the left speaker, and 1 means entirely in the
      right speaker.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * fname: The file name of the music given when it was created.

    the number of extra times to play the sound after it is played the
    first time; set to -1 or None to loop indefinitely.  ``maxtime``
    indicates the maximum amount of time to play the sound in
    milliseconds; set to None for no limit.  ``fade_time`` indicates the
    time in milliseconds over which to fade the sound in; set to 0 or

      room.
  * bbox_right: The position of the right side of the bounding box in
      the room.

      with 0 being directly to the right and rotation in a positive
      direction being counter-clockwise.
  * image_index: The animation frame currently being displayed, with 0
      being the first one.

      is the original image, 128, is half the opacity of the original
      image, 0 is fully transparent, etc.
  * image_blend: The color to blend with the sprite.  Set to None for no
      color blending.

  Read-Only Attributes:
  * id: The unique identifier for this object.
  * xstart: The initial value of x when the object was created.
  * ystart: The initial value of y when the object was created.
  * xprevious: The previous value of x.
  * yprevious: The previous value of y.


    IV.H.1. Constructor Method (sge.StellarClass.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.StellarClass.__init__(self, x, y, z, id=None, sprite=None,
        visible=True, detects_collisions=True, bbox_x=None, bbox_y=None,
        bbox_width=None, bbox_height=None, collision_ellipse=False,
        collision_precise=False, xvelocity=0, yvelocity=0,
        image_index=0, image_fps=0, image_xscale=1, image_yscale=1,
        image_rotation=0, image_alpha=255, image_blend=None)

    All arguments set the respective initial attributes of the object.
    If ``id`` is None, it will be set to an integer not currently used
    as an ID (the exact number chosen is implementation-dependent and
    may not be the same between runs).


    IV.H.2. sge.StellarClass.collides
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.StellarClass.collides(self, other, x=None, y=None)

    Returns whether or not this object collides with another.  ``other``
    indicates the object to check for a collision with.  ``other`` can
    also be a class to check for collisions with.  ``x`` and ``y``
    indicate the position to check for collisions at.  If set to None,
    this object's current position will be used.

    The normal collision rules will be used when this method is called.
    For example, if collision_precise is True, precise collision
    detection will be used.


    IV.H.3. sge.StellarClass.set_alarm
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.StellarClass.set_alerm(self, alarm_id, value)

    Sets the alarm with the given ``alarm_id`` at the given ``value``.
    The alarm will then reduce by 1 each frame (adjusted with delta
    timing, if enabled) until it reaches 0, at which point event_alarm
    will be executed with the same ID as was used here.  ``alarm_id``
    can be any value.  ``value`` should be a number greater than 0.  You
    can also set ``value`` to None to disable the alarm if it was
    set previously.


    IV.H.4. sge.StellarClass.get_alarm
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.StellarClass.get_alarm(self, alarm_id)

    Returns the number of frames (adjusted with delta timing, if
    enabled) before the alarm event with ``alarm_id`` will execute.  If
    the alarm has not been set, None will be returned.

    sge.StellarClass.event_create(self)

    Create event.  This event is executed when the object is created.
    It is always executed after any room start events occurring at the
    same time.

    Note that this event is executed when the object is created in a
    room, not necessarily when it is first created in Python.  In
    particular, if you create a StellarClass object normally, it is not
    created in a room until you add it with sge.Room.add.
    sge.StellarClass.create does this automatically.  Objects included
    in a rooms initial objects list are also automatically added.


    IV.H.7. sge.StellarClass.event_destroy
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.StellarClass.event_destroy(self):

    Destroy event.  This event is executed when this object is

    Mouse Button Press event.  This event is executed when a mouse
    button is pressed.  ``button`` indicates the number of the button
    that was pressed.  What button numbers correspond to what buttons
    can vary among implementations, so ``button`` should be checked
    against the following constants:

    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP
    * sge.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN

    joystick changes position.  ``joystick`` indicates the number of the
    joystick, where 0 is the first joystick.  ``axis`` indicates the
    number of the axis, where 0 is the first axis.  ``value`` indicates
    the tilt of the axis, where 0 is in the center, -1 is tilted all the
    way to the left or up, and 1 is tilted all the way to the right or
    down.  Note that ``value`` can be any floating-point number between
    -1 and 1; it is not limited to integral values.

  IV.J. sge.View
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This class controls what the player sees in a room at any given time.
  Multiple views can exist in a room, and this can be taken advantage
  for a split-screen effect.

  Attributes:
  * x: The horizontal position of the top-left corner of the view in the
      room, where the left edge of the room is 0 and x increases toward
      the right.
  * y: The vertical position of the top-left corner of the view in the
      room, where the top edge of the room is 0 and y increases toward
      the bottom.
  * xport: The horizontal position of the top-left corner of the view on
      the screen, where the left edge of the screen is 0 and xport
      increases toward the right.
  * yport: The vertical position of the top-left corner of the view on
      the screen, where the top edge of the screen is 0 and yport
      increases toward the bottom.
  * width: The width of the view in pixels.
  * height: The height of the view in pixels.


    IV.J.1. Constructor Method (sge.View.__init__)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    sge.View.__init__(self, x, y, xport=0, yport=0, width=None,
        height=None)

    All arguments set the respective initial attributes of the room.  If
    ``width`` or ``height`` is set to None, the respective size will be
    set such that the view takes up all of the space that it can (i.e.
    game.width - xport or game.height - yport).
